## Why now?
It is never too late to start your own blog. After several unsuccessful attempts with blogging I decided to start again. I already had the domain name so it took me less than an hour to set up this site. In this blog I will share challenges that I face with my everyday software development work, ideas about new projects and new technologies. In addition to that, hopefully, I will get lots of feedback through comments and connect with people having the same interests.

## Blog specs
The blog uses ~~toto~~ [hugo](https://gohugo.io) – a lightweight static site generator. The posts are text files using Mark Down syntax and all posts are published with git push command :)

## What to expect from me?
I’m a software engineer and you should expect posts related to all sorts of software development topics. I am interested in Golang, systems engineering and serverless technologies so expect some posts covering those topics.
