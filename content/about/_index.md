#General Info
My name is Pavel Nikolov, web developer, living in ~~Sofia, Bulgaria~~, Sydney, Australia. I have more than 10 years of experience as a software engineer. I develop all kinds of web applications (e-commerce, social apps, in-house business applications, etc.), mobile applications, data pipelines, systems etc.

I have done the corporate thing, the freelance thing and ~~now I have my own web development consultancy firm. I work on interesting projects mostly e-commerce and small business websites.~~ Now I work as a software engineer at Fairfax Media Publishing Innovation.

~~Other than that I am involved in a big project (which is a secret for now). I can only tell you that it is a social network built with node.js and MongoDB. After working about an year on that and four months in a row only on that (without being paid) I decided to step out of this project and get busy with other interesting projects.~~

## Technologies I Like
I have been involved in various kinds of projects throughout the years. The technologies I am mostly interested in (in no specific order) are:

Go
React
node.js
Java Script
AWS
Serverless

## Personal info
In the non-technical life I am a cyclist and love bicycles. ~~Before I started working from home I used to ride 50km per day - my daily commute~~ I still often go to work with my bicycle and again my commute is about 50km per day. I like traveling a lot. During the weekends I go the mountains and enjoy the wonderful views that we have here in Bulgaria.

During the winter I love skiing. I have been doing it since I was 6. And in the summer I spend a lot of time near the sea, enjoy the sunny weather, nice beaches and cold beer.
