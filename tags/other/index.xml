      <description>How it all began It&amp;rsquo;s been a little more than two years since I took the plunge and quit my job. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy decision. It was something I had wanted to do for quite some time. At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any saved money. On the other hand like most other people I had to pay rent, bills etc. So there was a little uncertainty. Luckily I was introduced to a guy in New York who was offering e-commerce platform services to people selling shoes, handbags etc.</description>
