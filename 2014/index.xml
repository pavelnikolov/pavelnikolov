      <description>My wife gave birth I am very happy to say that finally our long-waited son was born on 11th of April 2014. Both my wife and the baby are fine. The baby is 54cm and weighs 3.670kg.
It all started early yesterday when me an my wife went to the hospital[1] about 5pm. The doctor said it was too early and sent us back home. It was raining after several hot weeks.</description>

      <description>How it all began It&amp;rsquo;s been a little more than two years since I took the plunge and quit my job. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy decision. It was something I had wanted to do for quite some time. At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any saved money. On the other hand like most other people I had to pay rent, bills etc. So there was a little uncertainty. Luckily I was introduced to a guy in New York who was offering e-commerce platform services to people selling shoes, handbags etc.</description>
