      <description>Why now? It is never too late to start your own blog. After several unsuccessful attempts with blogging I decided to start again. I already had the domain name so it took me less than an hour to set up this site. In this blog I will share challenges that I face with my everyday software development work, ideas about new projects and new technologies. In addition to that, hopefully, I will get lots of feedback through comments and connect with people having the same interests.</description>
